<h3>Additional Details</h3>
<p>This minimal example uses the basic structure of a series of Shiny
apps being developed for the teaching of analytical chemistry. At
present there about 17 such Shiny apps in various stages of development,
with the expectation of creating a library of 50+ applications.
Resolving this issue now seems important to the projectâ€™s on-going
development.</p>
<p>The following programs/packages/hardware were used to create this
minimal example:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020) running Sonoma version 14.1.2</li>
<li>R version 4.3.2</li>
<li>RStudio version 2023.09.1+494</li>
<li>Shiny version 1.8.0</li>
<li>Shinythemes version 1.2.0</li>
<li>Rmarkdown version 2.25</li>
<li>knitr version 1.4.5</li>
<li>htmltools version 0.5.7</li>
</ul>
<p>The original example (<code>html_file1.html</code>) results in a
warning when the app is launched. The other two html files
(<code>html_file2.html</code> and <code>html_file3.html</code>) do not
generate additional warnings. Note that this file
(<code>details.html</code>) is an HTML fragment and, as expected, does
not throw off a warning.</p>
