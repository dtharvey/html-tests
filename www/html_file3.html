<h3>Solution 2: Delete Extra HTML Tags</h3>
<p>The original report, <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools/issues/124">#124</a>, on the
problem of including a full html file—one with a set of html tags placed
within a separate set of html tags—notes that <code>includeHTML()</code>
is intended to be used with a file that contains an HTML fragment. To
explore this, the file <code>html_file3.Rmd</code> in the
<code>www</code> folder was knit to HTML and saved in the
<code>www</code> folder as <code>html_file3.html</code> using the option
<code>output: html_document</code>; that is, the same process used to
create <code>html_file1.html</code>. This document was then opened in
the editor and the !DOCTYPE tag and the set of opening and closing html
tags were deleted and the document saved. As seen below, both the
mathjax mathematical expression and the mhchem chemical formula are
displayed correctly. No additional warning appears in the console.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>. Although this solution works in this case,
it feels like a cheat. What potential problems might this solution
create?</p>

<h3>Sample Text: Same Rmarkdown Used For All Tabs</h3>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>. In order to span a wide range of
concentrations, the sliders for concentration are logarithmic; the
titrand’s default concentration is (<em>using mathjax</em>) <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1} = 0.10 \text{ M}\)</span> and the
titrant’s default concentration is (<em>using Rmarkdown</em>)
10<sup>-0.7</sup> = 0.2 M.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>. The monoprotic weak base guanine,
(<em>using mhchem</em>) <span class="math inline">\(\ce{C5H5N5O}\)</span>, is insoluble in water, but
fully soluble in acid.</p>
