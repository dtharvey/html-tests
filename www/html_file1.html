<h3>Two Problems and Two Solutions</h3>
<p>The shiny applications for AC3.0 have a user interface that divides
the screen into two columns. The right column is used to display visual
elements, such as the image shown here as a placeholder. The left column
displays text by passing a <code>.html file</code> to
<code>includeHTML()</code>. The <code>.html</code> file was created by
knitting a <code>.Rmd</code> file using the option
<code>output: html_document</code>. This approach worked until fall 2023
when warnings showed up in the console noting that
<code>includeHTML()</code> was provided with a complete HTML document
and that this document should be placed, instead, within an iframe. The
warning comes from issue <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools/pull/382">#382</a>, which
resolved issue <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/htmltools/issues/124">#124</a>. The
change took effect with the release of version 0.5.6 of the
<code>htmltools</code> package on August 11, 2023. Although the text
displayed correctly, the warning is likely to trouble users; thus, the
need to fix the code, as noted above, so that a warning does not appear.
To solve the problem, <code>.Rmd</code> files were knit into
<code>.html</code> files using option
<code>output: html_fragment</code>. Using the html fragment introduced a
second problem as these files did not include a call to include MathJax;
the code at the top of the <code>.Rmd</code> files provides for this
call. Adding withMathJax() in the <code>ui.R</code> file ensures that
MathJax is available everywhere. The code at the beginning of each
<code>html</code> fragment was updated in August 2024 when it was
discovered that mhchem was not loading.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong> uses mathjax to format the first
mathematical expression and uses Rmarkdown to format the second
mathematical expression. <strong>Example 2</strong> uses mhchem to
display a chemical formula.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>. In order to span a wide range of
concentrations, the sliders for concentration are logarithmic; the
titrand’s default concentration is (<em>using mathjax</em>) <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1} = 0.10 \text{ M}\)</span> and the
titrant’s default concentration is (<em>using Rmarkdown</em>)
10<sup>-0.7</sup> = 0.2 M.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>. The monoprotic weak base guanine,
(<em>using mhchem</em>) <span class="math inline">\(\ce{C5H5N5O}\)</span>, is insoluble in water, but
fully soluble in acid.</p>
